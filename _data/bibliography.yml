  abstract:
    "We investigate the quantitative performance of affine-equivariant estimators
    for robust mean estimation. As a natural stability requirement, the
    construction of such affine-equivariant estimators has been extensively studied
    in the statistics literature. We quantitatively evaluate these estimators under
    two outlier models which have been the subject of much recent work: the
    heavy-tailed and adversarial corruption settings. We establish lower bounds
    which show that affine-equivariance induces a strict degradation in recovery
    error with quantitative rates degrading by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{d}\\) in both
    settings. We find that classical estimators such as the Tukey median (Tukey
    '75) and Stahel-Donoho estimator (Stahel '81 and Donoho '82) are either
    quantitatively sub-optimal even within the class of affine-equivariant
    estimators or lack any quantitative guarantees. On the other hand, recent
    estimators with strong quantitative guarantees are not affine-equivariant or
    require additional distributional assumptions to achieve it. We remedy this by
    constructing a new affine-equivariant estimator which nearly matches our lower
    bound. Our estimator is based on a novel notion of a high-dimensional median
    which may be of independent interest. Notably, our results are applicable more
    broadly to any estimator whose performance is evaluated in the Mahalanobis norm
    which, for affine-equivariant estimators, corresponds to an evaluation in
    Euclidean norm on isotropic distributions."
