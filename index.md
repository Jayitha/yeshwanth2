I am a postdoc at MIT where I am mentored by [Costis Daskalakis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/). I obtained my Ph.D at UC Berkeley where I was fortunate to be advised by [Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). I'm broadly interested in algorithmic and statistical issues arising in machine learning. 

Before this, I'd spent two wonderful years as a research fellow in the Machine Learning & Optimization group at Microsoft Research, India, where I was fortunate to work with [Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org), [Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/) and [Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) on designing provable algorithms for non-convex optimization. Previously, I received a B. Tech in Computer Science from IIT Bombay where I worked on Entity Linking and Disambiguation with [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) and [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) for my undergraduate thesis.
